    <p id = normaltxt>Here at the funyon, we prioritize fun over stories. What you'll find on our site is garbage, nonsense, flapjack, hogwash, and otherwise totally outrageous balderdash.</p>
    <p id = eviltxt>welcome to the evil funyon, i am the evil funyon</p>
    <p id = mobiletxt>Here you can find all the normal stuff you'd find on the funyon, except from the comfort of your own phone! look, even our images are smaller and more accomodating! look at our awesome, baby blue background! totally different from the color of an onion, thats how fun we are!</p>
    <img src="images/happy-buisness.png" alt="A grouop of normal business people." id = normalimg>
    <img src="images/Evil-business.png" alt="a group of EVIL business people." id = evilimg>
    <p id = normaltxt>Here at the funyon, we are exceptionally fond of our stark-white backgrounds and extremely squished images.</p>
    <p id = normaltxt>Accompanying that, we love our sophisticated and professional fonts.</p>
    <p id = eviltxt>gosh dang it i love being evil, look at those EVIL people above me.</p>
    <p id = mobiletxt>Isn't that just wonderful? why don't you try resizing the page to be the size of a desktop? just be sure to keep moving, and don't look too closely at The Space Inbetween...</p>
